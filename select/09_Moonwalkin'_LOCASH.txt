Girl, I admit it, I didn't make it too far (yeah, yeah)
No, I can't quit it, I want you back in my arms (yeah, yeah)
Now I want you so bad that it hurts (oh)
Throwing the shoes in reverse (oh)
You know I can't walk away

Girl, you got me moonwalkin', yeah, I'm moonwalkin'
Yeah, straight back to you, on a cloud of two flyin' through the sky
Baby, midnight rockin' (baby, midnight rockin')
Girl, you got me moonwalkin', yeah, I'm moonwalkin'

Girl, I can't hide it, already losing my mind (yeah, yeah)
Don't care who's watchin', I'm all about you tonight (yeah, yeah)
No, nothing gonna give it away, sliding back like I'm MJ
One kiss is all that it takes

Girl, you got me moonwalkin', yeah, I'm moonwalkin'
Yeah, straight back to you on a cloud of two flyin' through the sky
Baby, midnight rockin' (baby, midnight rockin')
Girl, you got me moonwalkin', yeah, I'm moonwalkin'

Yeah, got my heart beat like a backbeat jumpin'
Got my two feet movin' like I can't stop 'em
You know I can't walk away

Girl, you got me moonwalkin', yeah, I'm moonwalkin'
Straight back to you on a cloud of two flyin' through the sky
Baby, midnight rockin' (baby, midnight rockin')
Girl, you got me moonwalkin', yeah, I'm moonwalkin'
Girl, you got me moonwalkin', yeah, I'm moonwalkin'
