Moonwalkin', moonwalkin', yeah

Okay, okay, yeah
Floatin' on a dream, yeah, a fantasy, yeah
Immaculate vibes, do you feel this energy? Yeah
'Cause you got me seein' stars
No matter where we are
You, you, you shine like city lights, ey, like super bright, ey
Losin' track of time, burnin' through these summer nights, ey
With the world beneath our feet
There's nowhere I'd rather be
'Cause it's just

You and me (It's you and me)
Paradise (Paradise)
Levitatin' (Levitatin')
Like satellites, (Like satellites), yeah
And I don't wanna come back down

It feels like we are (Moonwalkin')
It feels like we are (Moonwalkin')
I'm fallin' for you at lightspeed
What a pretty world, sundress and some Nikes
It feels like we are (Moonwalkin')
It feels like we are (Moonwalkin')
Stardust in our bloodstream
Pretty, pretty world, sundress and some Nikes

Ey, yeah
And I could spend a thousand years, swimmin' through your atmosphere
Mm, yeah, yeah
What everybody's lookin' for, I feel like I found it here
'Cause you're so divine, you blow my mind
Those eyes, they get me everytime

It's you and me (It's you and me)
Paradise (Paradise)
Levitatin' (Levitatin')
Like satellites, (Like satellites), yeah
And I don't wanna come back down

It feels like we are (Moonwalkin')
It feels like we are (Moonwalkin')
I'm fallin' for you at lightspeed
What a pretty world, sundress and some Nikes
It feels like we are (Moonwalkin')
It feels like we are (Moonwalkin')
Stardust in our bloodstream
Pretty, pretty world, sundress and some Nikes
